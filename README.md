A in in python written discord bot allowing for interactions between discord and the geometry dash servers.

### What does it do?
- Allows users to check out their levels and dailys
- In addition users can like & comment on levels
- Linking GD accounts to discord

- Could allow users to get notified when their favoruirte creators upload new levels

### Can I use or edit this?
I would be happy if anybody wanted to take this further or actually use this for their servers.
